# TopoRoot+: Computing Whorl and Soil Line Traits of Maize Roots from CT Imaging

#Introduction

TopoRoot+ presents a complete, automatic, and high through-put phenotyping system based on TopoRoot using a single 3D X-ray CT scan of excavated maize root crowns. We build our computational methods for whorls and soil planes upon TopoRootâ€™s pipeline and its hierarchical skeletons.

# Installation and Execution

Please download the .exe file and put it at the same folder with the TopoRoot.exe

The program takes the smae input from TopoRoot. Change the TopoRoot.exe into TopoRoot_v2.exe, and the pipeline now will detect whorls and soil planes.

# Experiment Data

The data used for ground truth validation in our manuscript can be found here:
There are two new datasets: 
NAM: https://wustl.app.box.com/folder/214518933853
PlantHaven2021: https://wustl.app.box.com/folder/214380610514
PlantHaven2020 can be found in TopoRoot.
