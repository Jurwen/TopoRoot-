# whorl and soil plane detection


present a complete, automatic, and high through-put phenotyping system based on TopoRoot using a single 3D X-ray CT scan of excavated maize root crowns. We build our computational methods for whorls and soil planes upon TopoRootâ€™s pipeline and its hierarchical skeletons.
